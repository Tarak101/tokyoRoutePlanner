# Tokyo Metro Shortest Path Finder  

## 📖 Overview  
The **Tokyo Metro Shortest Path Finder** is an advanced Java-based application that calculates the shortest path between stations in the Tokyo Metro system using Dijkstra's algorithm. It features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing and precise geospatial computations to enhance route accuracy.  

---

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for optimized pathfinding.  
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface developed with Java Swing.  
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Accurate station coordinates for realistic visualizations.  
- **Real-World Accuracy**: Utilizes Haversine distance for precise routing between stations.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Java 11+  
- **UI Framework**: Java Swing  
- **Geospatial References**: Google Maps API (for station coordinates)  
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
